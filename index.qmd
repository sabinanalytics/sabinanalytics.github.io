I'm a Senior Fellow at [The Wharton Sports Analytics \& Business Initiative](https://wsb.wharton.upenn.edu/) and a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of [The University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). 

Previously I was the VP of Football Analytics at [SumerSports](sumersports.com) and a Senior Sports Data Scientist at [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/analytics/) where I authored analytics articles on [ESPN.com](espn.com) in addition to creating models and projections including, but not limited to, the Basketball Power Index [BPI](espn.com/bpi), [The Allstate Playoff Predictor](https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/cfbplayoffpredictor/cfb-playoff-predictor), Fantasy Soccer Projections, [NFL FPI](https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi). While at ESPN I also created the first of its kind objective data-based rating system for all college football and NFL players. 

I teach at Wharton and at Virginia Tech. I also provide Sports Analytics, statistics, and expert witness consulting services. To contact me, click the email button at the top of the site.
