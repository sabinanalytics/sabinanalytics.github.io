    "text": "Personal\nMy wife and I co-coach our coed basketball team of 4 girls and one boy. In my spare time I am chasing my goals in my recent hobby of marathon running and my lifelong love of waterskiing. I enjoy coaching my kids’ sports teams and while trying not to overthink strategy for elementary school aged soccer. I volunteer regularly in the community and at my local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n \n\n\nProfessional\nI’m a sports analytics expert with years of management experience. I built and grew a data science team from scratch working on NFL Football analytics problems at SumerSports. I have more than 5 years managing data science staff and driving key business decisions. At ESPN I led the development, implementation, and communication for many proprietary player & team metrics across NFL, CFB, NBA, CBB, and soccer.\nAmong those metrics, BPI and Strength of Record (SOR) are official metrics of the NCAA selection committee. Another, the Allstate Playoff predictor bring millions of people to ESPN to play out how their team can reach the playoff. CFB Real Plus-Minus was the first “objective” rating for every college football player.\n \n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPhd in statistics from Virginia Tech\nMS in statistics from BYU\nBA in French from BYU\nBS in statistics from BYU"

    "text": "Use a 3rd-party program\nRather than use the S3 website, I find it easier to use a different program that lets you drag and drop files from your computer to the S3 server and quickly get their URLs. The best (and free-est) program is called Cyberduck. Go to http://cyberduck.ch/ and download the Windows version and install it on your computer.\n\n\n\nDownload Cyberduck\n\n\nOnce it’s installed, you can use Cyberduck to connect to S3. The best way to do this is to save your connection information inside Cyberduck as a bookmark. Click on Bookmark &gt; New Bookmark to create one.\n\n\n\nCreate new bookmark\n\n\nIn the new bookmark dialog box, change the “FTP (File Transfer Protocol)” to “S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)”\n\n\n\nSelect S3 from the list\n\n\nGive the bookmark whatever nickname you want. Leave the server information as is. You can find your access key ID at the S3 website. Click on your name in the top right corner and select “Security Credentials” from the menu.\n\n\n\nSecurity credentials\n\n\nIf you get some warning or message about AWS Identity and Access Management, ignore it and click “Continue to Security Credentials”.\nClick on Access Keys and click on “Create New Root Key” to generate a new access key ID and secret access key. Copy these and save them somewhere safe.\n\n\n\nNew credentials\n\n\nPaste the access key ID into the Cyberduck bookmark and then close the bookmark editing dialog (for some reason it won’t let you enter the password until you try to connect to the server).\n\n\n\nFinish the bookmark\n\n\nOnce the bookmark dialog is closed, you’ll see the bookmark in the list of bookmarks. Double click on it to connect. Since this is your first time connecting, it’ll ask for your password. Paste in the huge crazy long secret access key, make sure “Save password” is checked, and click “Login”\n\n\n\nLog in\n\n\nYou’ll see a list of your buckets, just like on the website. Double click on the bucket you created to open it and see the folders.\nTo upload stuff, just drag files from your computer into folders in Cyberduck. You can even drag entire folders.\nGetting a URL for a file in Cyberduck is super easy. Right click on a file, go to “Copy URL” and choose “HTTP URL” (all the others are for other things you don’t need)\n\n\n\nCopy the file’s URL\n\n\nSometimes when you reopen Cyberduck, it’ll try to open the last folder it was in. If you want to get back to the list of bookmarks, click on the little bookmark icon near the top:\n\n\n\nBookmark icon\n\n\nThere’s only one caveat! Folders in S3 are private by default. If you drag a folder from your computer into the main root of the bucket (i.e. not into a folder you’ve already set as public), it’ll be private. You can either (1) log into the S3 website and right click on the folder to make it public, or (2) upload stuff to an already public folder. An easy way around this would be to create one main folder for uploaded stuff within your bucket and upload all other files and folders there—then anything you upload will automatically be public as well."

He had Z kids. Blah blah. He left several personal journals. The first (http://the-url-for-the-first-journal) was found in 1893 and talks about stuff. The second (http://the-url-for-the-second-journal) was found later and talks about other stuff. These are cool.\n\nAlternatively, if someone in your family wants a specific journal or scan, you can open Cyberduck, find the file, copy the URL and send it to them (rather than tracking down the specific blog post).\nThat’s all!"
