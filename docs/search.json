    "text": "Personal\nMy wife and I co-coach our coed basketball team of 4 girls and one boy. In my spare time I am chasing my goals in my recent hobby of marathon running and my lifelong love of waterskiing. I enjoy coaching my kids’ sports teams and while trying not to overthink strategy for elementary school aged soccer. I volunteer regularly in the community and at my local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n \n\n\nProfessional\nI’m a sports analytics expert with years of management experience. I built and grew a data science team from scratch working on NFL Football analytics problems at SumerSports. I have more than 5 years managing data science staff and driving key business decisions. At ESPN I led the development, implementation, and communication for many proprietary player & team metrics across NFL, CFB, NBA, CBB, and soccer.\nAmong those metrics, BPI and Strength of Record (SOR) are official metrics of the NCAA selection committee. Another, the Allstate Playoff predictor bring millions of people to ESPN to play out how their team can reach the playoff. CFB Real Plus-Minus was the first “objective” rating for every college football player.\n \n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPhd in statistics from Virginia Tech\nMS in statistics from BYU\nBA in French from BYU\nBS in statistics from BYU"

    "text": "I’m a Senior Fellow at The Wharton Sports Analytics & Business Initiative and a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. My formal education is in statistics and French and I have spent my entire career as a sports analytics professional. I teach and lead sports analytics research projects at Wharton but I also provide consulting services. I have a unique perspective on sports analytics problems having been exposed professionally and worked on problems across all major sports. I have worked with teams or on projects across various sports including NFL, Power 5 FBS football, NBA, college basketball, MLS, European soccer, MLB and sports media company ESPN. My most recent consulting clients have been an MLB team, a sports betting company, and a European soccer club.\nPreviously I was the VP of Football Analytics at SumerSports. There I led our football analytics efforts working with teams in the NFL. Before Sumer, I was a Senior Sports Data Scientist at ESPN. In 2016 at ESPN I led the revamp and relaunch BPI and introduced Strength of Record (SOR) for college basketball which are both official metrics used by the NCAA tournament selection committee. In college football I was the original creator of ESPN’s Allstate Playoff Predictor. I created Fantasy Soccer Projections for ESPN, and worked on other metrics such as NFL FPI and NBA BPI. I authored many articles for espn.com in addition to creating the first of its kind objective data-based rating system for all college football and NFL players.\nWith my training and expertise I am qualified to be an expert witness on statistical and sports analytics matters.

    "text": "Use a 3rd-party program\nRather than use the S3 website, I find it easier to use a different program that lets you drag and drop files from your computer to the S3 server and quickly get their URLs. The best (and free-est) program is called Cyberduck. Go to http://cyberduck.ch/ and download the Windows version and install it on your computer.\n\n\n\nDownload Cyberduck\n\n\nOnce it’s installed, you can use Cyberduck to connect to S3. The best way to do this is to save your connection information inside Cyberduck as a bookmark. Click on Bookmark &gt; New Bookmark to create one.\n\n\n\nCreate new bookmark\n\n\nIn the new bookmark dialog box, change the “FTP (File Transfer Protocol)” to “S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)”\n\n\n\nSelect S3 from the list\n\n\nGive the bookmark whatever nickname you want. Leave the server information as is. You can find your access key ID at the S3 website. Click on your name in the top right corner and select “Security Credentials” from the menu.\n\n\n\nSecurity credentials\n\n\nIf you get some warning or message about AWS Identity and Access Management, ignore it and click “Continue to Security Credentials”.\nClick on Access Keys and click on “Create New Root Key” to generate a new access key ID and secret access key. Copy these and save them somewhere safe.\n\n\n\nNew credentials\n\n\nPaste the access key ID into the Cyberduck bookmark and then close the bookmark editing dialog (for some reason it won’t let you enter the password until you try to connect to the server).\n\n\n\nFinish the bookmark\n\n\nOnce the bookmark dialog is closed, you’ll see the bookmark in the list of bookmarks. Double click on it to connect. Since this is your first time connecting, it’ll ask for your password. Paste in the huge crazy long secret access key, make sure “Save password” is checked, and click “Login”\n\n\n\nLog in\n\n\nYou’ll see a list of your buckets, just like on the website. Double click on the bucket you created to open it and see the folders.\nTo upload stuff, just drag files from your computer into folders in Cyberduck. You can even drag entire folders.\nGetting a URL for a file in Cyberduck is super easy. Right click on a file, go to “Copy URL” and choose “HTTP URL” (all the others are for other things you don’t need)\n\n\n\nCopy the file’s URL\n\n\nSometimes when you reopen Cyberduck, it’ll try to open the last folder it was in. If you want to get back to the list of bookmarks, click on the little bookmark icon near the top:\n\n\n\nBookmark icon\n\n\nThere’s only one caveat! Folders in S3 are private by default. If you drag a folder from your computer into the main root of the bucket (i.e. not into a folder you’ve already set as public), it’ll be private. You can either (1) log into the S3 website and right click on the folder to make it public, or (2) upload stuff to an already public folder. An easy way around this would be to create one main folder for uploaded stuff within your bucket and upload all other files and folders there—then anything you upload will automatically be public as well."

He had Z kids. Blah blah. He left several personal journals. The first (http://the-url-for-the-first-journal) was found in 1893 and talks about stuff. The second (http://the-url-for-the-second-journal) was found later and talks about other stuff. These are cool.\n\nAlternatively, if someone in your family wants a specific journal or scan, you can open Cyberduck, find the file, copy the URL and send it to them (rather than tracking down the specific blog post).\nThat’s all!"

    "text": "EPA (expected points added) is being used too much. There, I said it. Hear me out before you revoke my analytics club membership. I also want to state that no single application of EPA has driven me to this conclusion but rather many over the years including my own work quantifying player value using Bayesian models that uses EPA to estimate player value! From scrutinizing my own work and others I’ve come to the conclusion that EPA’s use as an evaluation tool should be limited largely to team drives and games, complete quarterback seasons, league-wide trends, and to inform other models like win probability. Use of EPA to evaluate per play averages in many specific game situations, in my opinion, should be discontinued.\nVirgil Carter & Robert Machol’s attempt to frame football in terms of expected points was revolutionary and perhaps the first influential sports analytics paper despite it being ignored for about 40 years. Thanks to Brian Burke’s site and then later work to make expected points models public (driven largely by Ron Yurko and Ben Baldwin), expected points and EPA as a way to analyze football has finally become mainstream. I remember the first time I heard my ESPN colleague (at the time) Domonique Foxworth casually use “EPA” without explanation on Around the Horn and I couldn’t stop smiling from my cubicle. We won!"

    "section": "Distribution of EPA on a Play",
    "text": "Distribution of EPA on a Play\nEPA is the difference of between the expected net number of points the team will score before the play happens and then after the play happens. The problem is that the distribution of expected outcomes on a football play is anything but unimodal or symmetric let alone normally distributed. So when we use EPA, it doesn’t actually mean that a 0 EPA play on a play is the 50th percentile outcome. Sometimes 0 EPA is well above the 50th percentile outcome, and sometimes it is well below!\nLet’s look at a few examples.\nChanging Distributional Shape of EPA Outcomes\nWe’ll start with the empirical distribution of EPA for a pretty neutral situation at midfield for each down and play type (run & pass).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each down there is a bimodal distribution of outcomes whose variance and skewness increase for each additional down. This matters because the means are pulled away from the center of the distribution towards the side of the skew. Players and teams that are in these situations will get credit or blame in terms of EPA for simply performing at the median or 50th percentile. For example a 50th percentile performance for a run on 3rd down and 10 at the 50 is worth -0.41 EPA despite it being simply the median outcome! If we are using EPA per play to compare players in certain situations and one player happened to be in this situation more than others then that alone will make them appear better.\nWe can also look at the most common starting field position of the 25 yard line (usually after a kickoff).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn even more extreme example of this, but still a common situation, is plays inside the 5 yard line in “goal to go” situations."

    "section": "Player Credit",
    "text": "Player Credit\nEPA is used often to compare player performances. In fact total EPA gained on the season for quarterbacks mirrors closely the results of the MVP voting. In recent years, several attempts have been made to assign credit to players based on how that player’s teams unit performs in terms of EPA (Paul Sabin Plus-Minus, PFF WAR, Yurko nflWAR, Baldwin EPA+CPOE composite, Kevin Cole Plus-Minus).\nBarring extreme situations where a player intentionally gives himself up instead of scoring at the end of the game to preserve possession and ensure victory, or going out of bounds to stop the clock, the goal of each player on a football team on each play is to advance the ball as far as possible towards the end-zone (for the offense) and likewise to prevent that from happening for the defense.\nThis begs questions such as, do we use EPA as the preferred metric because it’s the best metric to encapsulate individual and team performance on a play, or do we use it simply because it isn’t yards? And why can’t we just use yards in some situations? Is the same metric preferable for the whole season as for a set of plays in specific situations?"

    "section": "Yards vs EPA",
    "text": "Yards vs EPA\nWe all know that 10 yards on 3rd and 10 and 10 yards on 3rd and 20 are not worth the same to the offensive team. We know EPA accounts for this problem.\nLet’s consider the hypothetical situation, it is 3rd and 10 at exactly midfield in the 1st quarter of a 0-0 game.\n\n\nResult A: The team gains 9 yards.\n\nResult B: The team gains 10 yards.\n\n\n\n\nNow in terms of EPA, according to the NFLFastR model, the Expected Points before the play is 1.71 while the EPA for Result A is -0.09 compared to result B of 2.02.\nWhile in yards the team gained 10% more in situation B than A, in EPA one play is drastically different than the other. That is a massive difference for players with close to a coin flip difference in result. In causal inference we would call this spatial proximity. That means the difference of the play resulting in 9 yards vs 10 yards is mostly due to chance yet EPA results in a massive difference of that evaluation. If we are comparing players or teams in specific situations, our sample sizes can be overrun by these cliffs. If we do this as analysts we are making the same mistake fans make by overrating a team with an abundance of close wins.\nUsing Yards is OK\nEPA is still useful in many situations and so are yards. In fact, in a lot of situations yards are a better evaluation tool than EPA. Plus yards are understood better by casual fans and decision makers than EPA is.\nLet’s look at quarterbacks on 3rd down and less than 5 yards to go in the first half of games since 2011. I will include quarterback seasons with at least 25 snaps in this situation. I will also define Total Adjusted Net Yards as yards_gained + 20*touchdown - 45*turnover for all quarterback dropbacks (i.e. QB sacks, runs, and passes).\n\n\n\n\n\nAvg. QB Performance on 3rd and 5 or less (1st Half)\n2011-2023, data from NFLFastR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorted by EPA per play, the top of this list looks very reasonable. Patrick Mathomes, Jalen Hurts, and Peyton Manning are all at the top but then we get into some interesting names that we don’t typically think of when it comes to leading an NFL leaderboard of quarterbacks like Carson Wentz, Derek Carr, and Geno Smith.\nSure, these are smaller sample sizes because I’m filtering down, but this whole exercise is to examine what happens to EPA when we filter down. As analysts we make these comparisons or see others make these comparisons with similar sample sizes all the time!\nEven though each season is a much smaller sample size, we can make some conclusions with almost 300 or so of these quarterback seasons available to us. We can look at the stability from how a quarterback does one season to the next on 3rd and less than 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat\nStability\n\n\n\nEPA\n0.002\n\n\nTOT ANY\n0.004\n\n\nYDS\n0.093\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall samples are noisy so none of these have high year to year correlation, but ~ 0.10 is still a lot higher than 0.003!\nWhy is this?\nWell for a QB, over the course of a season, the benefits of accounting for yardline, down, distance, time remaining, etc. in EPA will make it more predictive than yards. The opposite can be true when we start splicing certain game situations. When we splice the data for certain situations in a game or for situations in a play that are correlated with situations in a game, using EPA may now hurt predictability because, among other things, the jump at the first down line coupled with small sample sizes. The goal of every team and player is to get as many yards as possible (with some very limited exceptions) so it is ok and can be preferable to use yards when we are honing in on specific situations."

Their estimate was that this distraction was equal to approximately 1.41 points per game. They reported that there was not a statistically significant difference between first half and second half free throw percentages due to the small sample size of their data.\nLuke Benz, a current Harvard PhD student and author of the ncaahoopR package, revisited the Arizona State distraction in 2019 and found that there was not enough evidence to conclude that teams shoot worse against Arizona State than they do at other road games.\nSurely with another 5 years of data one should be able to discern once and for all if Arizona State’s students have made a noticeable effect and if other teams have had similar impacts as well."

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nEach of the previous methods take a slightly different approach to estimating a crowd’s affect on free throw shooting, which begs the question, which method is best?\n2nd Half Student Section Effect\nThe first method which was to compare first half free throw shooting by visiting teams to that in the second half. While not every team may put a large student section behind the second half visiting team’s basket, we can see if the variance we see there across the nation is above what we would expect due to randomness.\nWe will filter our results to teams that have at least 200 free throws attempted at their home court in both the first half and second half over the course of this data set. The top 10 in terms of largest drop-off in free-throw percentage from the first first half to the second half can be seen in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also plot the histogram of the differences from the first half to the second half by each home team. What may be suprising in looking at it is that in fact, on average, visiting teams shoot 1 percent better in the second half than compared to the first.\nThis could be due to the effect of the end of game scenarios in basketball. Typically if a team is winning the losing team starts to foul towards the end of the game. The winning team knows this will happen and does its best to get the ball into the hands of their best free throw shooters before these fouls occur. We can see this trend in the following plot, where the difference in 2nd half free throw percentage goes up when a team wins by about 5-10, which is typically the range where the other team was fouling.\nThis doesn’t explain the entire effect as even teams that lose tend to shoot better percentage wise for free throws in the second half. There’s several possible explanations for this but my intuition was that as players got tired their free-throw percentages would decrease in the second half, which doesn’t appear to be the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo somewhat account for this second half effect I take that one percent in the second half off of a team’s free throw percentage when assessing the difference between the first half and the second half via the z-score and p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting Free Throw % by Half\n2015-16 to 2023-24 Seasons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some familiar names, including our famous “Curtain of Distraction” team, Arizona State is 9th overall in the biggest drop off from the first half to the second, and with the additional years of data, the result is statistically significant.\nBYU, another team that is increasingly known for its wild student section behind the basket in the second half, is 5th. While I don’t have data on all the teams and where their student sections are I did search out many of the teams in the top 10 of this list.\nSome of the top teams if their student sections are beind the visiting basket in the 2nd half,\n\nValparaiso: Yes\nLamar: Couldn’t Find\nMilwaukee: Yes\nArizona State: Yes\nBYU: Yes\nMiddle Tennessee State: Yes (last chart I could fine)\n\n\n\nBYU’s Student Section Attempting to Distract Opposing Shooter\n\nWhile a couple of promising names appear at the top of this list, it is possible that with over 350 Division I basketball teams, that we were sure to have some teams have a significant first half to second half effect on opposing free throw shooters.\nThere are some corrections for significance testing for multiple test that one can do such as the Bonferroni correction which would lower a significance threshold by dividing by the number of tests, so if we had a \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) threshold the new one would be \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{n}\\) where \\(n=355\\) teams in our dataset. Bonferroni is known for being overly conservative, and this surely would be an extremely high standard.\nI used the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to determine if there are some value for which we should still reject the Null Hypothesis that second half free throw percentage shouldn’t decrease from the first for a team after adjusting for the fact that on average second half free throw percentages increase by 1 percent that of the first half. Unfortunately there are also no teams that clear this multiple testing threshold.\n\n\n\nThis brings us to an interesting conundrum in this analysis. Say we were only testing that specific team’s students had an effect on 2nd half free throw shooting. If you were curious about Arizona State because of their curtain, then you could conclude that they do. I went to BYU and was curious about their fans and certainly in a vacuum their student section seems to impact free throw shots from the visiting team.\nBut, if we blanket test everyone in the nation, then it is less clear that is the case. This simple analysis is not accounting for specific free throw shooters ability and game situation which muddies the results. In my personal opinion, there is a mechanism, the students distracting behind the basket, for certain teams that I believe we have enough evidence to say that it does matter. If I were smart, I wouldn’t be testing this for every team in the country, but only for teams that I know have their students behind the basket trying to distract the shooter. That is actually a minority of the 350+ schools in the nation. Most stadiums don’t have that atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntire Game Effect\nEverything so far has been to look at the first half vs the second half free throw percentage for each team. Some teams don’t put their student sections behind the basket or don’t have a set routine to distract shooters. In fact, college basketball has many teams in Division I with no stands behind the basket whatsoever.\nA different way to analyze the affect a crowd has on free throw shooting would be to build a model that adjusted for the visiting team’s true ability in free-throw shooting percentage. This model would ignore half by half effects and simply look at each game as a whole.\nWhy Use Team Performance?\nFree throws should follow a Poisson-Binomial distribution. While each shot is an independent event, the probability of success should vary because the different shooting ability for each player. Player shooting samples sizes are small for game by game analysis, but we can do an analysis where we estimate a team’s free throw shooting ability using game results. I look at a team’s free throw shooting percentage in home games and compare that to the free throw shooting percentage at each true road game in a season.\nOthers have pointed out that it is not clear whether a better comparison for effectiveness of a crowd would be to compare free throw percentage of the visiting team’s other road games or to compare them to their home games.\nI chose to compare the free throw percentage to the visiting team’s home games. I did this because each team’s home games are in the same location each time, reducing the effect that a unique road schedule may have on teams in certain conferences more than others. One example would be teams that have to travel further or to higher elevations in their conference. My previous work at ESPN consistently showed elevation to have an effect on team efficiency in college basketball and this paper from Lopez, Matthews, & Baumer suggested odds makers adjust for it in professional sports.\nMy model can be defined as\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_i &= \\beta_0 + \\gamma_j + g(x_{1,i})\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon\\\\\n\\gamma_j &\\sim LaPlace(0,1)\\\\\n\\epsilon & \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) is the difference the visiting team’s free throw percentage in game \\(i\\) and its free throw percentage in their home games that season. \\(\\gamma_j\\) is the effect of the home team \\(j\\)’s home crowd/venue on the free throw percentage for the visiting team. \\(g(x_i)\\) is a nonlinear natural spline on the absolute value of the final score margin. This is to adjust for differences in games that are close at the end and ones that are not.\nThe home venue effect is given a Laplace prior distribution centered around 0. The Laplace prior is equivalent to LASSO regression and shrinks estimates towards 0. If a school’s effect outweighs that shrinkage it will still be estimated to have an effect. I also weight the observations by the total number of free throw attempts in the game.\nThis method can’t differentiate between effects traveling to a school harder to get to or elevation since that data wasn’t as readily available. The model should be able to account for differences in schedule and opponent free throw ability."

    "text": "2nd Half Student Section Effect\nI filtered the data to teams that have at least 200 free throws attempted at their home court in both the first half and second half over the course of this data set. The top 10 in terms of largest drop-off in free-throw percentage from the first half to the second half can be seen in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also plotted the histogram of the differences in free throw percentage from the first half to the second half by each home team. What is suprising in looking at first glance is that, on average, visiting teams shoot 1 percent better in the second half than compared to the first.\nThis is likely due to the effect of the end of game scenarios in basketball. Typically, if a team is winning the losing team starts to foul towards the end of the game. The winning team knows this will happen and does its best to get the ball into the hands of their best free throw shooters before these fouls occur. You can see this trend in the following plot, where the difference in 2nd half free throw percentage goes up when a team wins by about 5-10, which is typically the range of outcomes where the other team was fouling.\nThis doesn’t explain the entire effect as even teams that lose tend to shoot better percentage wise for free throws in the second half. There’s several possible explanations for this but my intuition was that as players got tired their free-throw percentages would decrease in the second half, which doesn’t appear to be the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo somewhat account for this second half effect I take that one percent in the second half off of a team’s free throw percentage when assessing the difference between the first half and the second half via the z-score and p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting Free Throw % by Half\n2015-16 to 2023-24 Seasons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some familiar names, including our famous “Curtain of Distraction” team, Arizona State among the biggest drop offs from the first half to the second, and with the additional years of data, the result is statistically significant.\nBYU, another team that is increasingly known for its wild student section behind the basket in the second half, is also high on this list. While I don’t have data on all the teams and where their student sections are I did quick research on where many of the teams in the top 10 of this list have their student sections in the second half.\n\nValparaiso: behind visiting basket\n\nLamar: I couldn’t find\nMilwaukee: behind visiting basket\n\nArizona State: behind visiting basket\n\nBYU: behind visiting basket\n\nMiddle Tennessee State: behind visiting basket\n\n\n\n\nBYU’s Student Section Attempting to Distract Opposing Shooter\n\nSome not surprising names appear near the top of this list. Although, it is possible that with over 350 Division I basketball teams, that some by shear randomness, some will have a significant first half to second half effect on opposing free throw shooters.\nThere are some corrections for significance testing for multiple tests that one can do such as the Bonferroni correction which would lower a significance threshold by dividing by the number of tests, so if we had a \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) threshold the new one would be \\(\\frac{\\alpha}{n}\\) where \\(n=355\\) teams in our dataset. Bonferroni is known for being overly conservative, and this surely would be an extremely high standard.\nI used the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to determine if there are some values for which one should still reject the null hypothesis that second half free throw percentage shouldn’t decrease from the first for a team. (Remember that I adjusted for the fact that on average second half free throw percentages increase by 1 percent that of the first half.) Unfortunately there are also no teams that clear this multiple testing threshold.\n\n\n\nThis brought me to an interesting conundrum in this analysis. I allowed every team in the nation in my sample. If I restricted it to ones I had specific hypotheses about them this would be stronger evidence. Arizona State was one of those teams. In isolation its effect is explained beyond randomness alone. I went to BYU and was curious about their fans and certainly, in isolation, their student section seems to impact free throw shots from the visiting team.\nThis simple analysis is not accounting for specific free throw shooters ability and game situation which muddies the results. In my personal opinion, there is a mechanism, such as the students displaying distractions behind the basket, that explains why certain teams may have an effect. To me, that enhances the evidence.\nIf I were smart, I wouldn’t be testing this for every team in the country, but only for teams that I know have their students behind the basket trying to distract the shooter. That is a minority of the 350+ schools in the nation. Most stadiums don’t have that atmosphere."

    "text": "Entire Game Effect\nEverything so far has been to look at the first half vs the second half free throw percentage for each team. Some teams don’t put their student sections behind the basket or don’t have a set routine to distract shooters. In fact, college basketball has many teams in Division I with no stands behind the basket whatsoever.\nA different way to analyze the affect a crowd has on free throw shooting would be to build a model that adjusted for the visiting team’s true ability in free throw shooting percentage. This model would ignore half by half effects and simply look at each game as a whole.\nWhy Use Team Performance?\nFree throws should follow a Poisson-Binomial process. While each shot is an independent event, the probability of success should vary because each player has a different shooting ability. Player shooting samples sizes are too small for game by game analysis, so I stuck to using a team’s free throw shooting percentage on a game to game basis. I used the difference of the visiting team’s free throw shooting percentage in that game to its free throw shooting percentage in home games that season.\nOthers have pointed out that it is not clear whether a better comparison for effectiveness of a crowd would be to compare free throw percentage of the visiting team’s other road games or to compare them to their home games.\nI chose home games. I did this because each team’s home games are in the same location each time, reducing the effect that a unique road schedule may have on teams in certain conferences more than others. One example would be teams that have to, on average, travel further or to higher elevations in their conference. My previous work on BPI and SOR at ESPN consistently showed elevation to have an effect on team efficiency in college basketball and this paper from Lopez, Matthews, & Baumer suggested market lines adjust for it in professional sports.\nFor the purposes of assessing which fan bases may have an effect, I grouped all season’s together for the home team when assessing a fan base, but for the individual team shooting performances I treated each season separately.\nMy model can be defined as\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_i &= \\beta_0 + \\gamma_j + g(x_{1,i})\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon\\\\\n\\gamma_j &\\sim Laplace(0,1)\\\\\n\\epsilon & \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) is the difference the visiting team’s free throw percentage in game \\(i\\) and its free throw percentage in their home games that season. \\(\\gamma_j\\) is the effect of the home team \\(j\\)’s home crowd/venue on the free throw percentage for the visiting team. \\(g(x_i)\\) is a nonlinear natural spline on the absolute value of the final score margin. This was motivated by wanting to adjust for free throw differences in games that are close at the end compared to others.\nThe home venue effect is given a Laplace prior distribution centered around 0. The Laplace prior is equivalent to LASSO regression and shrinks estimates towards 0. I also weighted the observations by the total number of free throw attempts in the game.\nThis method can’t differentiate between crowd effects and the effect of long travel or high elevation since that data wasn’t as readily available. The model should be able to account for differences in visiting teams free throw ability, overall difficulty of shooting free throws on the road, the effect of close games, and the empirical average impact of the venue played at."

    "text": "Data\nI am missing venues for some of the data, a total of 330 games out of 15618 . A summary of the total missing venues for the each season is shown below.\n\n\n\n\nseason\ngames\n\n\n\n2005\n49\n\n\n2006\n50\n\n\n2007\n57\n\n\n2008\n35\n\n\n2009\n28\n\n\n2010\n28\n\n\n2011\n33\n\n\n2012\n26\n\n\n2013\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the latitude and longitude of the game’s stadium and each team’s respective home stadiums I calculate the distance traveled for each team and any effects of elevation. For the purposes of this study I will not adjust capacity differences as that can reasonably be part of the home field effect. I do show the correlation between my estimates and attendance later on.\n\n\n\nThe estimated average home field advantage for all teams from 2005 to 2023 is 0.11 points per drive for the home team. With an average of 12.5 offensive drives for each team we can estimate the average home field advantage is 2.8 points per game.\nWhile I make estimates for average team ability since 2005 in each season of the dataset and each venue they played at in that timespan, I am only assessing the most recent stadium a team has played in for the following analysis if a team has had more than one home stadium since 2005.\nEven with 18 years of data, it is difficult to detect if a team has a stronger home field advantage than another. That being said, 2 of them show evidence of being a weaker home field advantage than the average college stadium and 9 show significant evidence of having a stronger home field advantage than other stadiums.\nThere are a total of 247 current unique home stadiums between FBS and FCS that I have in my dataset. If I am assessing 247 teams home stadiums in my dataset to see if they have a stronger or weaker home field advantage than the average college football team, if there is no effect I would expect 20 percent of the teams to have a posterior probability greater than 0.80 of being different than the average home field advantage (HFA). That would be about 49 teams. In fact my analysis shows that only 11 teams meet such a threshold. Thus, even the teams we do observe with a home field advantage are likely due to chance.\nDespite the inconclusive effects for HFA for most teams, I am able to at least provide an estimate for each team’s home stadium, even if the evidence isn’t that strong. This estimate shows the estimated HFA as points per drive for each home team above that of an average home field advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Stadium Home Field Advantage (HFA)\nVs. Avg. HFA 2005-2023 Seasons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see even for Army (the highest effect) once we multiply its posterior mean home effect by the average drives in a game, it comes out to 2.2 points per game which is about double the estimated average home field advantage effect of 2.8 points per game (assuming an average number of drives per game)."

    "text": "Attendance\nOne of the factors in the EA Sports rankings was the number of fans in the stands but our model doesn’t show fan attendence as correlated with the stadium specific home field advantage. It even appears that attendence is slightly negatively correlated with the specific home field advantage effects. This goes against intuition as crowd noise is believed to be able to impact penalties like false starts and also referee behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is an important confounder here which is team ability. Better football schools traditionally have bigger stadiums and fan support. Perhaps teams with better players and by extension more fans also have players that are less likely to be impacted by opposing fans or their own fans.\nThis also brings up another point which is that this model solely measures how teams play at their home compared to the average home field advantage. For Army this could be for reasons around the strict routine of West Point or its unique offense which lends itself to play better at home than the road that have nothing to do with Michie Stadium. Then again who wouldn’t be affected by military cannons blasting at you and soldiers jumping out of helicopters?\nIn order to fully disentangle a team’s typical performance on the road against the effect of the stadium they’re playing out, additional effects for a team’s road performance need to be added to estimate this. With already small effects for stadium specific advantages without all those additional parameters, this is unlikely to increase the significance of these effects."
