    "text": "Personal\nMy wife and I co-coach our coed basketball team of 4 girls and one boy. In my spare time I am chasing my goals in my recent hobby of marathon running and my lifelong love of waterskiing. I enjoy coaching my kids’ sports teams and while trying not to overthink strategy for elementary school aged soccer. I volunteer regularly in the community and at my local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n \n\n\nProfessional\nI’m a sports analytics expert with years of management experience. I built and grew a data science team from scratch working on NFL Football analytics problems at SumerSports. I have more than 5 years managing data science staff and driving key business decisions. At ESPN I led the development, implementation, and communication for many proprietary player & team metrics across NFL, CFB, NBA, CBB, and soccer.\nAmong those metrics, BPI and Strength of Record (SOR) are official metrics of the NCAA selection committee. Another, the Allstate Playoff predictor bring millions of people to ESPN to play out how their team can reach the playoff. CFB Real Plus-Minus was the first “objective” rating for every college football player.\n \n\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPhd in statistics from Virginia Tech\nMS in statistics from BYU\nBA in French from BYU\nBS in statistics from BYU"

    "text": "Use a 3rd-party program\nRather than use the S3 website, I find it easier to use a different program that lets you drag and drop files from your computer to the S3 server and quickly get their URLs. The best (and free-est) program is called Cyberduck. Go to http://cyberduck.ch/ and download the Windows version and install it on your computer.\n\n\n\nDownload Cyberduck\n\n\nOnce it’s installed, you can use Cyberduck to connect to S3. The best way to do this is to save your connection information inside Cyberduck as a bookmark. Click on Bookmark &gt; New Bookmark to create one.\n\n\n\nCreate new bookmark\n\n\nIn the new bookmark dialog box, change the “FTP (File Transfer Protocol)” to “S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)”\n\n\n\nSelect S3 from the list\n\n\nGive the bookmark whatever nickname you want. Leave the server information as is. You can find your access key ID at the S3 website. Click on your name in the top right corner and select “Security Credentials” from the menu.\n\n\n\nSecurity credentials\n\n\nIf you get some warning or message about AWS Identity and Access Management, ignore it and click “Continue to Security Credentials”.\nClick on Access Keys and click on “Create New Root Key” to generate a new access key ID and secret access key. Copy these and save them somewhere safe.\n\n\n\nNew credentials\n\n\nPaste the access key ID into the Cyberduck bookmark and then close the bookmark editing dialog (for some reason it won’t let you enter the password until you try to connect to the server).\n\n\n\nFinish the bookmark\n\n\nOnce the bookmark dialog is closed, you’ll see the bookmark in the list of bookmarks. Double click on it to connect. Since this is your first time connecting, it’ll ask for your password. Paste in the huge crazy long secret access key, make sure “Save password” is checked, and click “Login”\n\n\n\nLog in\n\n\nYou’ll see a list of your buckets, just like on the website. Double click on the bucket you created to open it and see the folders.\nTo upload stuff, just drag files from your computer into folders in Cyberduck. You can even drag entire folders.\nGetting a URL for a file in Cyberduck is super easy. Right click on a file, go to “Copy URL” and choose “HTTP URL” (all the others are for other things you don’t need)\n\n\n\nCopy the file’s URL\n\n\nSometimes when you reopen Cyberduck, it’ll try to open the last folder it was in. If you want to get back to the list of bookmarks, click on the little bookmark icon near the top:\n\n\n\nBookmark icon\n\n\nThere’s only one caveat! Folders in S3 are private by default. If you drag a folder from your computer into the main root of the bucket (i.e. not into a folder you’ve already set as public), it’ll be private. You can either (1) log into the S3 website and right click on the folder to make it public, or (2) upload stuff to an already public folder. An easy way around this would be to create one main folder for uploaded stuff within your bucket and upload all other files and folders there—then anything you upload will automatically be public as well."

He had Z kids. Blah blah. He left several personal journals. The first (http://the-url-for-the-first-journal) was found in 1893 and talks about stuff. The second (http://the-url-for-the-second-journal) was found later and talks about other stuff. These are cool.\n\nAlternatively, if someone in your family wants a specific journal or scan, you can open Cyberduck, find the file, copy the URL and send it to them (rather than tracking down the specific blog post).\nThat’s all!"

    "text": "EPA (expected points added) is being used too much. There, I said it. Hear me out before you revoke my analytics club membership. I also want to state that no single application of EPA has driven me to this conclusion but rather many over the years including my own work quantifying player value using Bayesian models that EPA to assign player value! From scrutinizing my own work and others I’ve come to the conclusion that EPA’s use as an evaluation tool should be limited largely to team drives and games, complete quarterback seasons, league-wide trends, and to inform other models like win probability. Use of EPA to evaluate per play averages in many specific game situations, in my opinion, should be discontinued.\nVirgil Carter & Robert Machol’s attempt to frame football in terms of expected points was revolutionary and perhaps the first influential sports analytics paper despite it being ignored for about 40 years. Thanks to Brian Burke’s site and then later work to make expected points models public driven largely by Ron Yurko and Ben Baldwin, expected points and EPA as a way to analyze football has finally become mainstream. I remember the first time I heard my ESPN colleague (at the time) Domonique Foxworth casually use “EPA” without explanation on Around the Horn and I couldn’t stop smiling from my cubicle. We won!"

    "section": "Distribution of EPA on a Play",
    "text": "Distribution of EPA on a Play\nEPA is the difference of between the expected net number of points the team will score before the play happens and then after the play happens. The problem is that the distribution of expected outcomes on a football play is anything but unimodal or symmetric let alone normally distributed. So when we use EPA, it doesn’t actually mean that a 0 EPA play on a play is the 50th percentile outcome. Sometimes 0 EPA is well above the 50th percentile outcome, and sometimes it is well below!\nLet’s look at a few examples.\nChanging Distributional Shape of EPA Outcomes\nWe’ll start with the empirical distribution of EPA for a pretty neutral situation at midfield for each down and play type (run & pass).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each down there is a bimodal distribution of outcomes which gets larger variance and more skewness for each additional down. This matters because the means are pulled away from the center of the distribution towards the side of the skew. Players and teams that are in these situations will get credit or blame in terms of EPA for simply performing at the median or 50th percentile. For example a 50th percentile performance for a run on 3rd down and 10 at the 50 is worth 0.83 EPA despite it being simply the median outcome! If we are using EPA per play to compare players in certain situations and one player happened to be in this situation more than others then that alone will make them appear better.\nWe’ll also look at the most common starting field position of the 25 yard line (usually after a kickoff) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn even more extreme example of this, but still a common situation, is plays inside the 5 yard line in “goal to go” situations."

    "section": "Player Credit",
    "text": "Player Credit\nEPA is used often to compare player performances. In fact total EPA gained on the season for quarterbacks mirrors closely the results of the MVP voting. In recent years, several attempts have been made to assign credit to players based on how that player’s teams unit performs in terms of EPA (Paul Sabin Plus-Minus, PFF WAR, Yurko nflWAR, Baldwin EPA+CPOE composite, Kevin Cole Plus-Minus).\nBarring extreme situations where a player intentionally gives himself up instead of scoring at the end of the game to preserve possession and ensure victory, or going out of bounds to stop the clock, the goal of each player on a football team on each play is to advance the ball as far as possible towards the end-zone as possible (for the offense) and likewise to prevent that from happening for the defense.\nThis begs the question, do we use EPA as the preferred metric because it’s the best metric to encapsulate individual and team performance on a play, or do we use it simply because it isn’t yards? And why can’t we just use yards in some situations? Is the same metric preferable for the whole season as for a set of plays in specific situations?"

    "section": "Yards vs EPA",
    "text": "Yards vs EPA\nWe all know that 10 yards on 3rd and 10 and 10 yards on 3rd and 20 are not worth the same to the offensive team. We know EPA accounts for this problem.\nLet’s consider the hypothetical situation, it is 3rd and 10 at exactly midfield in the 1st quarter of a 0-0 game.\n\n\nResult A: The team gains 9 yards.\n\nResult B: The team gains 10 yards.\n\n\n\n\nNow in terms of EPA, according to the NFLFastR model, the Expected Points before the play is 1.71 while the EPA for Result A is -0.09 compared to result B of 2.02.\nWhile in yards the team gained 10% more in situation B than A, in EPA one play is drastically different than the other. That is a massive difference for players with essentially a coin flip difference in result. In causal inference we would call this spatial proximity. That means the difference of the play resulting in 9 yards vs 10 yards is mostly due to chance yet EPA results in a massive difference of that evaluation. If we are comparing players or teams in specific situations, our sample sizes can be overrun by these cliffs. If we do this as analysts we are making the same mistake fans make by overrating a team with an abundance of close wins.\nUsing Yards is OK\nEPA is still useful in many situations and so are yards. In fact, in a lot of situations yards are a better evaluation tool than EPA. Plus yards are understood better by casual fans and decision makers than EPA is.\nLet’s look at quarterbacks on 3rd down and less than 5 yards to go in the first half of games since 2011. I will include quarterback seasons with at least 25 snaps in this situation. I will also define Total Adjusted Net Yards as yards_gained + 20*touchdown - 45*turnover for all quarterback dropbacks (i.e. QB sacks, runs, and passes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvg. QB Performance on 3rd and 5 or less (1st Half)\n2011-2023, data from NFLFastR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorted by EPA per play the top of this list looks very reasonable. Patrick Mathomes, Jalen Hurts, and Peyton Manning are all at the top but then we get into some interesting names that we don’t typically think of when it comes to leading an NFL leaderboard of Quarterbacks like Carson Wentz, Derek Carr, and Geno Smith.\nSure, these are smaller sample sizes because I’m filtering down, but this whole exercise is to examine what happens to EPA when we filter down. As analysts we make these comparisons or see others make these comparisons with similar sample sizes all the time!\nEven though each season is a much smaller sample size, we can make some conclusions with almost 300 or so of these quarterback seasons available to us. We can look at the standard deviation from how a quarterback does one season to the next on 3rd and less than 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat\n      Stability\n    \n\n\nEPA\n0.003\n\n\nTOT ANY\n0.010\n\n\nYDS\n0.099\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall samples are noisy so none of these have high year to year correlation, but ~ 0.10 is still a lot higher than 0.003!\nWhy is this?\nWell for a QB, over the course of a season, the benefits of accounting for yardline, down, distance, time remaining, etc. in EPA will make it more predictive than yards. The opposite can be true when we start splicing certain game situations. When we splice the data for certain situations in a game or for situations in a play that are correlated with situations in a game, using EPA may now hurt predictability because, among other things, the jump at the first down line coupled with small sample sizes. The goal of every team and player is to get as many yards as possible (with some very limited exceptions) so it is ok and can be preferable to use yards when we are honing in on specific situations."
